<h2>Introduction </h2> 
<p> 
In this experiment we introduce you to two very famous algorithmic problems.One problem is longest continuous decreasing subsequence problem and other one is longest increasing subsequence problem.
</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li><h2>Problem 1:</h2>
<p> 
Given a list of n distinct numbers (where n &lt= 1000), find the length of the longest monotone decreasing subsequence.
</p>
<p>
Definition : A monotone decreasing subsequence is a sequence of numbers (contiguously placed in the list) which are strictly decreasing from left to right. For example, if we have the series ”2 1 9 8 10 7 5 4 3 1 10”, then the subsequence ”10 7 5 4 3 1” is contiguously arranged and monotonically decreasing. Thus, the answer to be printed out for the length of ”10 7 5 4 3 1” which is 6. Note that the sequence ”9 8 7 5 4 3 1” is not a subsequence we are looking for as the numbers are not contiguous placed in the list.

<b>Input Specification</b><br />
<p>
Input will contain some positive integers separated by spaces. The number of integers is not specified and the input will be terminated by end of file. Each integer is &lt= 10<sup>9</sup>  and the length of the input sequence is &lt= 10<sup>7</sup>.
</p>

<b>Output Specification</b><br />
<p>
Print the length of the longest continuous decreasing subsequence.

<li><h2>Problem 2:</h2>
<p> 
Given a set of n distinct numbers, find the length of the longest monotone increasing subsequence. Note that the sequence need not be continuous(Refer: Section 4.7 of Dromey).
</p>

<b>Input Specification</b><br />
<p>
Input will contain two lines. The first line contains the number of integers in the sequence, N(&lt=1000) and the next line contains N positive integers (each &lt=10<sup>9</sup>).

<h2>Theory</h2> 
<h2>Problem 1</h2>
<p>
This is a fairly straight-forward problem. We have to determine the length of the longest subsequence in which all the elements are smaller than the previous ones. It is easy to see that each of these decresing subsequences will end either when the current number is bigger than the previous number, or when the current number is the final number in the sequence. Also, the end of one sequence marks the beginning of another sequence. So, this problem is easy to solve if we can note down the lengths of these sequences and find the largest number in them. All this can be done while the input is being read. You just need to keep track of the length of the current sequence and the length of the largest sequence which has been seen till now. As discussed earlier, if the currrent number is lesser than the previous number then the length of the current sequence is incremented by 1, and if the current number is greater than the previous number, then the current sequnce ends and we check whether its length is the greatest that has been seen till now, and we also start a new sequence with length equal to 1. When, then input sequence ends then also the current sequence is deemed as terminated, and we again check its length against the length of the largest sequence seen till now.

<h2>Problem 2</h2>
<p>
This is a very famous problem. It's known as longest increasing subsequence problem.Let us consider a naive approach of solving this problem. For every subsequence if it is a increasing subsequence we try to update the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence.If we analyse the time complexity of this appraoch it is clear that it is goin to take 2<sup>N</sup>*N operations. So, if N = 30, this approach would take 32212254720 (~3*10<sup>11</sup>) operations. Looking at the constraints it is obvious that this algorithm is not feasible. Now we look at the standard solution. You may refer wikipedia for the same.  
</p>
<p>
Every subsequence has to end with some element of the sequence. So we calculate the length of the longest incresing subsequence subject to the constraint that the subsequence ends with seq[i].Lets say that it is best[i]. The answer will be max(best[0],best[1],...,best[N-1]). 
</p>
<p>

<h4>Recursive formulation </h4>
Now the task is to find a recursive formula for best[i]. Assume we know the values of best[0],best[1],..., best[i-1] and now out task is to find best[i]. Seq[i] can form a increasing subsequence with some Seq[j] if Seq[i] &gt Seq[j] and j &lt i. Thus the recusive formula is <br>
<b> best[i] = max(1,best[j]+1|j&lt i && Seq[i]>Seq[j]) </b>
